# wordle-solver

I made this wordle solver using the selenium library on python. I used basic search and elimination on the list of answers available on the internet to build this. I plan on adding a login function to this which would allow me to run this code once a day and get a get streak going.

It does everything from opening the wordle website and even closing the pop-up menu. 

Here's a working demo of the same:

You can run this on your desktop too!
